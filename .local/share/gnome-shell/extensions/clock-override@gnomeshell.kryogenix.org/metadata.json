  "description": "Override the Gnome Shell clock with a new time format or text of your choice.\n\nGnome Shell doesn't permit many changes to the format of its clock; in particular, it's not possible to remove it completely or to add text around it. That's what this extension is for: you can set the clock's 'format string' to change how the Gnome Shell clock is displayed (do you want it as HH:MM? HH.MM? '10:37:21 am'?), including setting it to just a fixed string (for example, a bell) so you have somewhere to click to see notifications and calendar but no clock on-screen.\n",
